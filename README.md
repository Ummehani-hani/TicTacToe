# TicTacToe
 I created a Tic Tac Toe game website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After setting up the files and a basic navigation bar, I designed the game layout and added styling. I then implemented the game logic in JavaScript, added responsiveness for various devices, and included an animation to highlight the winning move.
